# ⬇️ AI Options Portfolio & Daily Trade Screener

## 📖 What This Does
This bad boy is like having a caffeinated Wall Street intern on speed dial.
It picks 9 AI-chad stocks (tech, healthcare, energy—you name it) and sniffs out every spicy options play on them.
We pipe in live Tastytrade data (yes, real-time tendies intel), including those mysterious things called Greeks—basically the nerd math behind option prices.

Then it cranks the numbers, filters out the trash, and spits out the Top 3 YOLO‑but‑not‑too‑YOLO trades of the day—
aka high‑probability, low‑"oops I blew up my account" setups—wrapped in a clean little table so you don’t have to think too hard.

## 🧠 Why Build This?
- **Too many stonks, too little brainpower:** Thousands of stocks, millions of option combos—ain’t nobody got time for that. We laser focus on **AI big dogs only**.  
- **Option overload:** Instead of eyeballing 50,000 trades till your eyes bleed, we run the math and serve the **juicy ones only**.  
- **Greeks? Bruh.** Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega? Sounds like a frat house. Don’t worry—we pull those numbers for you.  
- **Risk control = Don’t nuke the account:** Simple rules keep the losses from looking like your ex’s credit card bill.

## 🤖 AI Pick 9 Ticker Trading Portfolio Prompt

#### Attachment
- us_tickers.csv

#### Instructions 

**Goal**  
Construct a 9-ticker, sector-diversified options portfolio emphasizing:  
- **High Implied Volatility (IV)** (rich premiums & IV Rank ≥ 30%)  
- **Deep Liquidity** (OI ≥ 1,000 per leg; spreads ≤ $0.05 for top names, ≤ $0.10 for moderately liquid)  
- **Strong Short-Term Swings** (same-day to 30 days)  
- **Industry-Leading AI Exposure** in each sector  
- **Significant Market Attention** (institutional/retail hype)  

**Selection Criteria (ALL must be met)**  
1. **AI Leadership**: Core business or initiative is AI-driven.  
2. **Options Liquidity**: Weekly/monthly chains, ≥ 1,000 OI on each leg, tight spreads.  
3. **Elevated IV + IV Rank ≥ 30%**: Ensure options are richly priced relative to their history.  
4. **Public Buzz**: Recent catalysts, heavy newsflow, or social/institutional interest.  
5. **Robinhood-Available**: U.S.-listed and accessible to retail traders.  

**Technical & Risk Filters**  
- **Primary Signal (RSI(5))**: Confirm short-term momentum (oversold/overbought swings).  
- **Secondary Signal (MACD Crossover)**: Validate momentum for directional plays (debit spreads, straddles).  

**Rebalance Triggers**  
- **IV Rank < 30%** → remove/replace  
- **Stop-Loss Hit** → exit and free capital  
- **Profit Target Hit** → lock in gains  
- **Rebalance Cadence**: Event-driven only (no routine weekly unless a trigger fires)  

**Portfolio Construction**  
Select exactly one ticker per sector (no duplicates), drawn from the NASDAQ,  include any high-IV recent IPOs or AI spin-outs that meet all criteria.

| Sector                  | AI Theme                                                   |

# ⬇️ Workflow 2 | Download TastyTrade Data

## 🛠 Setup & Install
To use this beast, you gotta armor up your computer with a few tools.  
Don’t sweat it—this ain’t rocket surgery, just some basic setup so you can flex like a pro trader.

### Step 1 – Make a Home for Your Tendies Code
First, create a new folder where you’ll keep all the files for this project. Open a terminal (a program where you can type commands to your computer) and type:

```bash
mkdir tastytrade_data
cd tastytrade_data
```
- **Why?** This keeps all your scripts and data in one place, like organizing your tendies in a box.

### Step 2 – Install Required Packages
Next, you need to install some packages that the project needs to work. These are like tools that help the project do its job. Type this in the terminal:

```bash
pip install tastytrade websockets pandas httpx certifi
```
- **Why?**
  - `tastytrade`: Lets the project talk to the Tastytrade website to get data.
  - `websockets`: Helps get live updates on the Greeks.
  - `pandas`: Handles and calculates with the data.
  - `httpx` and `certifi`: Make secure connections to the internet.

## 🔐 Test Your Tastytrade Login
Before we can get any data, we need to make sure your computer can connect to Tastytrade.

### Step 3 – Create & Run Login Test
Create a new file called `test_connection.py` by typing:

```bash
touch test_connection.py
open -e test_connection.py
```
Add this code to the file:

```python
import requests
import json

# Test basic connection to TastyTrade
print("Testing TastyTrade API connection...")

url = "https://api.tastytrade.com/sessions"
print(f"API URL: {url}")
print("Ready for authentication test")
```
Save the file and run it by typing:

```bash
python3 test_connection.py
```
- **Why?** If it prints without any errors, it means the connection is working.

## 🔑 Authenticate & Get Account Info
Now, we need to log in to your Tastytrade account so the project can get data for you.

### Step 4 – Create Authentication Test
Create another file called `auth_test.py`:

```bash
touch auth_test.py
open -e auth_test.py
```
Add this code:

```python
import requests
import json

# Your TastyTrade credentials
USERNAME = "USERNAME"
PASSWORD = "PASSWORD"

# Test authentication
url = "https://api.tastytrade.com/sessions"
data = {
    "login": USERNAME,
    "password": PASSWORD
}

print("Attempting to authenticate...")
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(f"Status code: {response.status_code}")

if response.status_code == 201:
    print("SUCCESS: Authentication worked!")
    result = response.json()
    print("Session token received")
else:
    print("FAILED: Authentication failed")
    print(f"Error: {response.text}")
```
- **Important:** Replace `"your_username_here"` and `"your_password_here"` with your actual Tastytrade username and password.

Run the file:

```bash
python3 auth_test.py
```
- **Why?** If it says "SUCCESS: Authentication worked!", then we’re ready to go.

## 📊 Pull Options Chains + Greeks

This program pulls live stock option data for 9 AI-related stocks from Tastytrade and organizes it into spreadsheets, ready for deeper analysis like the Black-Scholes model. 

### Here’s what happens step by step:
1. Login to Tastytrade – Uses your username and password to access the trading account, just like logging into a game or shopping app.
2. Choose Stocks – Works from a pre-set list of 9 AI-focused stocks (like NVDA, TSLA, AMZN).
3. Grab the Options Chain – Downloads every available option (strike prices and expiration dates) for each stock, similar to looking at a menu of all choices.
4. Filter Short-Term Options – Focuses on contracts expiring within 30 days, so you only see near-term opportunities.
5. Pull Live Market Data – Connects to a live data feed to get:
   - Current stock prices
   - Bid/ask prices (what buyers and sellers want)
   - Greeks (risk and sensitivity numbers)
6. Calculate Key Stats – Figures out things like days to expiration, how close each strike is to the stock price (“moneyness”), mid-price, and intrinsic value.
7. Highlight “At-the-Money” Options – Flags options closest to the current stock price (often the most relevant for trading).
8. Combine All Data – Organizes everything into a single, easy-to-read table for each stock.
9. Mark Ready-for-Analysis Options – Adds a “bs_ready” checkmark showing which options have all data for your Black-Scholes model.
10. Save to Files – Creates a clean spreadsheet for each stock with all relevant columns (prices, Greeks, volatility, time left, etc.).

### What You Get
Each stock has a CSV file ready for analysis, so you can quickly:
1. Spot mispriced options
2. Run fair-value checks with Black-Scholes
3. Focus on the best short-term trading opportunities


### Step 5 – Create the Script
Create a new file called `get_options_chain_with_dxlink.py`:

```bash
touch get_options_chain_with_dxlink.py
open -e get_options_chain_with_dxlink.py
```

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Enhanced options chain fetch with live Greeks and pricing data
for Black-Scholes model preparation - DEBUG VERSION

- **Important:** Replace `"your_username"` and `"your_password"` with your actual credentials. Also, set `TICKER` to the stonks you want to look at, like "AAPL" for Apple.

Run the script:

```bash
python3 get_options_chain_with_dxlink.py
```
- **Why?** This creates a file called `AAPL_options_chain_with_greeks.csv` (or whatever ticker you chose) that has all the options data with Greeks.

Run it:

```bash
python3 select_top_trades.py
```
- **Why?** This prints out the top 3 trades based on some dummy data (since the actual filtering logic isn’t implemented here).

**Instructions**  
**Goal** Validate the **3 selected trades** from the AI‑optimized portfolio for execution readiness, including **macro/news risk checks, sector exposure sanity, and portfolio Greek balance**. Provide a final confidence check before trading.  

#### Data Inputs  
- **Trade Candidates:** 3 top‑scored option trades (from previous prompt)  
- **Market Data:** POP, Credit/Max‑Loss, DTE, Strategy, Thesis (from attached table)  
- **Macro Context:** Key upcoming earnings, Fed events, geopolitical risks, sector catalysts  

#### Validation Criteria  
1. **Confirm Trade Quality:** POP ≥ 0.66, Credit/Max‑Loss ≥ 0.33, DTE within strategy target bucket.  
2. **Portfolio Exposure:** No sector > 2 trades, Net Delta roughly balanced (∈ [–0.30,+0.30] × NAV/100k), Net Vega ≥ –0.05 × NAV/100k.  
3. **Catalyst Scan:** Flag upcoming earnings, Fed/geo headlines, or sector news that could affect volatility or invalidate thesis.  
4. **Sentiment & Flow Check:** Consider social sentiment, institutional flow, and analyst rating consensus.  
5. **Event Risk Tag:** Identify any ticker with a near‑term risk event (earnings, product launch, regulatory ruling).  

#### Output Table Schema  
| Ticker | Strategy | Legs | Thesis (≤ 30 words) | POP | Credit/Max‑Loss | DTE | Sector | Risk/Event Note | Confidence |

### Prompt:  
Apply **the Instructions** to the attached data.  
1. **Output only** the clean, markdown‑wrapped table with columns:  
`Ticker, Strategy, Legs, Thesis (≤ 30 words), POP, Credit/Max‑Loss, DTE, Sector, Risk/Event Note, Confidence`  
   - **Risk/Event Note:** Short bullet (e.g. “Earnings in 5d”, “Fed risk”, “Sector upgrade momentum”).  
   - **Confidence:** High / Medium / Low based on combined signals.  
2. **Then add a brief commentary block** summarizing:  
   - Why these trades remain valid under current macro/news context  
   - Any portfolio risk adjustments needed (e.g., sector overweight, delta/vega imbalance)  
   - Key external catalysts to monitor before entry.

| ISRG   | Credit Put Spread | Short Put 435.0 / Long Put 430.0 | Robotic surgery leader; bullish bias  | 0.70 | 0.35            | 28  | Healthcare  | Post-earnings (strong Q2)    | High       |
| PLTR   | Credit Put Spread | Short Put 140.0 / Long Put 135.0 | AI software platform leader; bullish bias | 0.70 | 0.35            | 28  | Financials  | Earnings 8/4 (in 10d)       | Medium     |

## Commentary

**Macro/News Context:**  
The broader backdrop remains supportive of these bullish trades. The Federal Reserve is holding interest rates steady for now, and tech-heavy indexes continue to hit record highs amid the AI boom. Nvidia (NVDA) has resumed sales of advanced AI chips to China, boosting its stock, and analysts reaffirm it as a top pick with clear growth visibility. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) just delivered strong quarterly results, confirming its growth thesis. Palantir (PLTR) secured a new $30 million Army AI contract, underscoring its momentum. No adverse news threatens these trade theses.

**Portfolio Risk Adjustments:**  
All three positions are bullish credit put spreads in AI-centric names, creating thematic concentration. This adds positive **delta** (bullish bias) and short **vega** (volatility risk). Consider balancing with non-tech or defensive positions if needed. Position sizing and diversification are key, though the ∼70% POP for each trade keeps risk manageable.

**Key Catalysts to Monitor:**  
- **Federal Reserve meeting (July 31)** – potential macro volatility  
- **Palantir earnings (Aug 4)** – within trade duration, may cause swings  
- **Nvidia earnings (late August)** – post-expiry but may influence sentiment  
- Broader tech earnings and economic data (jobs, inflation) – could shift market momentum
